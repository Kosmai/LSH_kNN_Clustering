# Nearest Neighbors/Clustering using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

This repository includes our code for the assignments of "Software Development for Algorithmic Problems" course in Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, NKUA. It's divided in 3 parts:

* Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for searching appoximate nearest neighbors in d-dimensional space & K-Means Clustering
* Time Series nerest neighbor search using LSH based on L2/Discrete Frechet/Continuous Frechet distance metrics & Time Series Clustering
* Time Series Forecasting/Anomaly Detection/Dimensionality Reduction using Deep Learning (RNNs & CNNs)
